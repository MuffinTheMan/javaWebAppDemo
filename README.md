## Use Gradle
Gave up for now on Vagrant, due to lack of interest in wrestling with Tomcat permissions on the VM right now. Work with Gradle's use of `gretty` plugin in order to start focusing on actual JSP development.

Simply start up with `./gradlew appRun`.

## Incorporate Foundation
Link to Foundation files for css/js in views/templates.
